#Welcome to the FoP
The Framework of Paradise is a PHP MVC micro framework.

If you liked CodeIgniter, chances are you might get along with the FoP.  I always liked the way CI way was so light and swift, and the intuitive nature of its routing.  At the same time, I wanted to be able to utilise modern PHP joys, in particular namespacing, and also have the framework step out of the way where OOP is concerned, now that PHP does OOP pretty much as well as anything else.  I was also keen to lighten the DB layer, use PDO, and have complete control of it.

Micro explains the FoP very well at present.  These are its key features:

* Adheres to the MVC pattern
* HTTP router provides clean URLs as standard, and both dynamic and static routing
* Easy to use command line interface.
* Lightweight DB layer - wraps PDO, available to all models, offers convenient methods which utilise paramaterised SQL as standard.
* Easily extensible - drop a properly namespaced library class into app/lib, and fill yer boots
