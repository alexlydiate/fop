#Welcome to the FoP
The Framework of Paradise is a PHP MVC micro framework.

If you liked CodeIgniter, chances are you might get along with the FoP.  I always liked the way CI way was so light and swift, and the intuitive nature of its routing.  At the same time, I wanted to be able to utilise modern PHP joys, in particular namespacing, and also have the framework step out of the way where OOP is concerned, now that PHP does OOP pretty much as well as anything else.
